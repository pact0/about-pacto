## What do I do in my free time?

In addition to my day-to-day work, I'm engaged in several personal projects related to Path of Exile and self-hosting.
I also make custom mechanical keyboards and enjoy listening to music on high quality audio gear.

I'm a firm believer that a diverse range of interests can lead to a more well-rounded and creative approach to problem-solving.

### Home Lab!

I have a passion for self hosting stuff and working with servers. I have some equipment at home to fiddle with.

* **HP T730** - as my pfsense
* **Aruba S2500 48 PoE** - managed switch
* **Dell R720** - server where I self host and lab around
* **UniFi 6** - Access Point
* **Raspberry Pi 4** - for my Home Assistant needs


## Stuff I Made

### [TFT Trade Extension](http://chrome.extension.tftrove.com)

This is a browser extensions with a bunch of addons for a Path of Exile trade website. Over 60 000 people are already using it.

* [firefox](http://firefox.extension.tftrove.com)
* [chrome](http://chrome.extension.tftrove.com)

There is a ton of features available. Here is a short video explaining how to use them.

### [Bulk Selling Tool](https://bulk.tftrove.com)

Another tool for Path of Exile - it allows users to log in via their in game account using OAuth2, access their stashes and create listings which then can be posted on a community [discord](https://discord.gg/tftrove).
